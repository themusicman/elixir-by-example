# Elixir By Example

If you're an engineer looking to upgrade your Elixir skills, this resource is for you!

Elixir is a modern, functional, concurrent programming language that runs on the rock-solid Erlang VM. It's designed to build scalable, fault-tolerant applications with low-latency distributed systems in mind.

In this repo you will find [LiveBook](https://livebook.dev/) notebooks with examples of Elixir that you can import and have fun with.

We welcome pull requests from all developers to contribute their own tips, tricks, and examples to share their knowledge.
